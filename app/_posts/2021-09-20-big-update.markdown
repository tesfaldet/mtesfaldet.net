After 3 years of not touching this site, I've decided to update it. A lot of the missed "news" should be caught up through my CV. In the meantime, submit to the [Machine Learning for Creativity and Design workshop](https://neuripscreativityworkshop.github.io/2021/) I'm co-organizing for NeurIPS 2021. Due date is this Friday.
