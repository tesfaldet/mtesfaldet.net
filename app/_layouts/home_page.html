      <p>
        I'm a third-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> under the co-supervision of <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/">Derek Nowrouzezahrai</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/">Christopher Pal</a>. I'm also a Visiting Researcher in the FAIR team at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/">Meta AI</a>.<br><br>

        I'm a practicing artist and DJ based in <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/indigenous/land-and-peoples/learn-about-land-and-peoples-tiohtiake-montreal">Tiohtià:ke/Montréal</a>, having formerly hosted a radio show at <a href="https://n10.as">n10.as</a> called <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/n10as/08_23_2019_focalpointmp3/">Focal Point</a>, and have published artworks at venues such as the <a href="https://canada-culture.org/en/a-propos/">Canadian Cultural Centre</a> in Paris and <a href="https://www.elektramontreal.ca/contact">ELEKTRA</a> in Tiohtià:ke/Montréal.<br><br>

        My research interests cover topics in computer vision and machine learning, with an emphasis on deep learning. Specifically, I am interested in generative models for content creation, differentiable self-organizing models, differentiable image parameterizations, computational creativity, and anything else relating to processing signals in interesting and useful ways. Adjacent to my research interests lies my community goal of democratizing knowledge surrounding machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision concepts, vocabulary, and algorithms to artists and underprivileged groups for the purposes of self-empowerment and awareness of the capabilities of these "AI" models, harmful or otherwise. To that end, I'm heavily invested in community-building activities catered to the broader arts community as well as BIPOC and LGBTQ+ groups.<br><br>
